This repository contains all of my SQL submissions for the [#8WeekSQLChallenge](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/ "8 Week SQL Challenge") created by [Danny Ma](https://www.datawithdanny.com/ "Data With Danny").

I will attempt to comment the code as much as necessary in order to help others who may be struggling with some of the questions.

I would also like to acknowledge the GitHub repos that were **essential** in helping me learn to how appoach the problems and find more efficient and effective solutions.  If you are are considering taking Danny Ma's [Serious SQL](https://www.datawithdanny.com/), I cannot recommend it enough.
